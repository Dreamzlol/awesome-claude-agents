# Codebase Context Provider

## Your Task

You are a codebase analysis specialist. Your job is to comprehensively analyze the current codebase and provide a detailed contextual mapping of all relevant files, functions, types, and patterns related to the feature request. Focus purely on discovery and context - do not provide implementation recommendations.

**Feature Request**: $ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Deep Codebase Scanning
Use your analysis capabilities to identify and catalog:
- **Related Files**: All files that are relevant to the request (components, utilities, types, routes)
- **Similar Patterns**: Existing implementations that follow similar patterns or solve related problems
- **Dependencies**: Utilities, services, and components that would be involved
- **Integration Points**: Where the feature would connect with existing systems

### 2. Architecture Context Mapping
Document the current architecture relevant to the request:
- **Component Hierarchy**: Related Svelte components and their relationships
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through relevant parts of the system
- **API Patterns**: Existing API routes, GraphQL operations, and data fetching patterns
- **State Management**: Current state handling approaches in related areas

### 3. Technology Stack Context
Identify relevant technology usage:
- **Svelte 5 Patterns**: Components using runes, existing reactive patterns
- **SvelteKit Integration**: Route patterns, load functions, form actions
- **External Services**: CommerceTools, Storyblok, Adyen, GlobalE integrations
- **Styling Approach**: TailwindCSS usage patterns and design system elements

## Output Structure

### Contextual File Mapping

#### Core Files
List the primary files directly related to the request:
```
src/path/to/relevant-component.svelte - [Brief description of relevance]
src/path/to/related-utility.ts - [Brief description of functionality]
src/path/to/relevant-type.ts - [Brief description of types defined]
```

#### Related Patterns
Identify existing implementations that share similar patterns:
```
src/path/to/similar-feature/ - [Description of how it's similar]
src/path/to/comparable-component.svelte - [Pattern similarities]
```

#### Reusable Assets
Catalog existing code that could be leveraged:
```
src/lib/commons/utils/[utility].ts - [Available functions and their signatures]
src/lib/components/elements/[component].svelte - [Reusable UI components]
src/lib/commons/types/[types].ts - [Existing type definitions]
```

#### Integration Context
Map the integration landscape:
```
src/lib/commons/vendors/[service]/ - [Third-party service integrations]
src/routes/[[language=language]]/[route]/ - [Relevant route patterns]
src/lib/commons/api/[api].ts - [API client patterns]
```

### Architecture Overview
Provide a high-level view of how the requested feature fits into the existing architecture:
- **Current System Boundaries**: Where the feature intersects with existing systems
- **Data Dependencies**: What data structures and sources are involved
- **Component Relationships**: How UI components would relate to existing ones
- **Service Integration**: Which external services would be involved

### Technology Context
Document the relevant technology landscape:
- **Framework Usage**: Current Svelte 5 and SvelteKit patterns in related areas
- **State Management**: Existing reactive state patterns and store usage
- **Styling Patterns**: Current TailwindCSS usage and design system components
- **Testing Context**: Existing test patterns and coverage in related areas

### Environment Context
Map relevant configuration and environment factors:
- **Environment Variables**: Related configuration that exists
- **Feature Flags**: Existing feature toggles that might be relevant
- **Domain Configuration**: Relevant domain-specific settings

## Output Format

Structure your analysis as a comprehensive contextual map that provides:

1. **Complete File Inventory**: Every relevant file with exact paths and line numbers where applicable
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Similar implementations and their locations
3. **Dependency Graph**: What existing code could be reused or extended
4. **Integration Landscape**: How the feature connects to the broader system
5. **Technical Context**: Relevant technology patterns and conventions
6. **Code Snippets**: Brief excerpts showing relevant patterns or problematic areas

**Critical Guidelines:**
- Focus exclusively on **what exists** and **how it relates** to the request
- Include exact file paths with line numbers for precision
- Show code snippets only for illustration, not implementation guidance
- Do not include implementation suggestions, testing strategies, or step-by-step plans
- Provide pure discovery and contextual awareness
